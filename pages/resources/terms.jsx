				<hr className="mt-4" />
				<Title level="h2" className="mt-9">
					Color Proofing
				</Title>
				<Paragraph>
					A full color contract proof is used to simulate how the printed piece will look. Because
					of differences in equipment, paper, inks, and other conditions between color proofing and
					production pressroom operations, a reasonable variation in color between color proofs and
					the completed job is to be expected. PDF and Web proofs are intended only to determine
					design, layout, and text accuracy. Tiger Expo Design is not liable for color matching or
					ink density of PDF or Web proofs. It is important to note that images on computer monitors
					are RGB and process printing is CMYK, thus the colors shown on your monitor will not
					exactly match the final printed piece and the color accuracy will mostly depend on the
					calibration and accuracy of your monitor. Make sure to ask for a full color contract proof
					if the accuracy of the colors is important to you. Most critical color reproductions
					require a press check. You must request a press check at the time submitting your quote
					request. Loss of press time due to customer delay, changes, revisions, or corrections at
					the time of a press check is subject to current rates.
				</Paragraph>

				<hr className="mt-4" />
				<Title level="h2" className="mt-9">
					Creative Work
				</Title>
				<Paragraph>
					Any creative work created by Tiger Expo Design for a print job is subject to copyright
					laws. It may not be used for any reason except by written permission from Tiger Expo
					Design. Once permission has been granted, any derivation of ideas from the work or
					compensation (if any) is to be determined by Tiger Expo Design.
				</Paragraph>

				<hr className="mt-4" />
				<Title level="h2" className="mt-9">
					Delivery
				</Title>
				<Paragraph>
					Unless otherwise specified, the price quoted is for a single shipment, without storage,
					F.O.B. Tiger Expo Design loading dock. Proposals are based on continuous and uninterrupted
					delivery of the complete order. If the specifications state otherwise, Tiger Expo Design
					will charge accordingly at current rates. Charges for delivery of materials and supplies
					from the customer to Tiger Expo Design, or from the customer&apos;s representative to
					Tiger Expo Design, are not included in quotations unless specified. Title for finished
					work passes to the customer upon delivery to the carrier at shipping point, or upon
					mailing of invoices for the finished work or its segments, which ever occurs first.
				</Paragraph>

				<hr className="mt-4" />
				<Title level="h2" className="mt-9">
					Electronic Manuscript or Image
				</Title>
				<Paragraph>
					It is the customer&apos;s responsibility to maintain a copy of the original file. Tiger
					Expo Design is not responsible for accidental damage to media supplied by the customer or
					for the accuracy of furnished input or final input. Until digital input can be evaluated
					by Tiger Expo Design, no claims or promises are made about Tiger Expo Design&apos; ability

					that may arise. Any additional translating, editing, or programming needed to utilize

				<Title level="h2" className="mt-9">
					Copyrights
				</Title>
				<Paragraph>
					The customer warrants that the subject matter to be printed is not copyrighted by a third
					party. The customer also recognizes that because subject matter does not have to bear a
					copyright notice in order to be protected by copyright law, absence of such notice does
					not necessarily assure a right to reproduce. The customer further warrants that no
					copyright notice has been removed from any material used in preparing the subject matter
					for reproduction. To support these warranties, the customer agrees to indemnify and hold
					Tiger Expo Design harmless for all liability, damages, and attorney fees that may be
					incurred in any legal action connected with copyright infringement involving the work
					produced or provided.

					scandalous, or anything that threatens anyone&apos;s right to privacy or other personal or
					economic rights. The customer will, at the customer&apos;s sole expense, promptly and
					thoroughly defend Tiger Expo Design in all legal actions on these grounds as long as the
					Tiger Expo Design promptly notifies the customer of the legal action and gives the
					customer reasonable time to undertake and conduct a defense. Tiger Expo Design reserves
					the right to use its sole discretion in refusing to print anything it deems illegal,
					libelous, scandalous, improper, or infringing upon copyright law.
				</Paragraph>

				<hr className="mt-4" />

					Tiger Expo Design&apos; liability for breach of this warranty is limited, at its option,
					(i) to repairing or replacing the defective goods at no cost to Customer or (ii) crediting
					Customer for its variable unit cost paid to credit for defective number of goods. Variable
					unit cost means the price per piece charged to the Customer for goods produced. In no
					event will Tiger Expo Design be liable for any indirect, special, consequential, punitive
					or exemplary damages for any matter arising under this contract, and/or for negligence.
					Tiger Expo Design warrants that the work is as described in the quotation letter. The
					customer understands that all sketches, copy, dummies, and preparatory work shown to the
					customer are intended only to illustrate the general type and quality of the work. They
					are not intended to represent the actual work performed.
